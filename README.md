# Employee Directory Dashboard

This is a dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the 8th project in the Treehouse FEWD Techdegree. It pulls user objects from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and then builds the dashboard using JS.

### Challenges

This project expanded on previous skills learned through the Techdegree, and allowed for new challenges with javascript. One of my favorite additions for this project was allowing a carousel scroll through employee profiles when the overlay is open. Also, the search input allows you to filter employees by first or last name.
